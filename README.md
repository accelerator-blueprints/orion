This repository is a collection of packages that can be used as a foundation for a statically built, GraphQL-driven knowledgebase.

## Architecture

The project architecture follows a JAMStack, Serverless application model. The picture shows a high level architecture diagram.

![architecture](./docs/architecture.png)

## Project structure

The application is stored in a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo.

### [./.circleci](./.circleci)

CircleCI [knowledgebase project](https://circleci.com/gh/nearform/knowledgebase) continuous integration configuration.

### [./hasura](./hasura)

The application follows a serverless application model, where the only API used by the frontend is exposed through GraphQL via [Hasura](https://hasura.io).

This folder contains the migrations and scripts necessary to run them.

### [./packages/components](./packages/components)

> note, this package is currently, temporarily unused until we sort out the direction we want to go with the design system

- a component library based on [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- a design system with a `ThemeProvider` approach to theming and using
  [saluki](https://github.com/nearform/saluki) for its CSS-in-JS modular
  approach with sane defaults similar in concept to [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/)

### [./packages/app](./packages/app)

- a static build enabled app based on [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)
- Gatsby uses [graphql](https://graphql.org/) to fetch data from the API

### [./packages/nearform-theme](./packages/nearform-theme)

- material-ui theme with NearForm branding
- wrapper component to apply common styles to the application

### [./packages/functions](./packages/functions)

- lambda serverless functions used to interact with AWS Cognito and Hasura

## Project setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/nearform/knowledgebase.git

cd knowledgebase

npm i
```

### 2. Configure

Most of the configuration comes from environment variables. Required environment variables for each part of the architecture are documented in the `.env.sample` files inside the repository.

- app [`.env.sample`](./packages/app/.env.sample) - build time environment variables for the Gatsby application. They should also be configured in CI, along with any other environment variables required by CI
- hasura [`.env.sample`](./hasura/.env.sample) - runtime environment variables for Hasura and Hasura console. They need to be configured when running Hasura or Hasura console.
- functions [`.env.sample`](./packages/functions/.env.sample) - runtime environment variables for AWS Lambda functions.

Shared secrets are stored in a vault. Get in touch with a team member to get access to it.

## Contributing

1. Clone the project.
2. Pick an issue to work on from the project board.
3. Work on a new branch using the convention `{change type}/{change name}`. For instance `feature/signup-form` or `fix/broken-signup form`.
4. Commit changes using conventional commits via Commitizen: `git cz`. This requires installing [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) first.
5. Reference the issue in the commit message (the conventional commits wizard prompts for that at some point), for instance `Fixes #12`. Doing this, GitHub will close the issue once the PR that references it in this way gets merged.
5. Create a pull request and get someone to review it.
6. Once approved, you as the author of the PR should merge it.

## Running the application

Ensure you have a local `.env.development` file available.

```
cd packages/app
npm start
```

## Storybook

The components package contains storybook stories to document and test the components contained therein.

```
cd packages/components
npm run storybook
```
