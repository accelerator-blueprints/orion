Identify and describe your organisation’s key strategic objectives & challenges. The rest of the entries you make into the Assess Base should keep these in mind so that the information provided is built around the strategic challenges of your organisation. e.g., the key approaches you have in place to help you achieve your Vision and how you measure the success of your endeavours (Results). This will allow Assessors to focus on what really matters to your organisation and bring more value to the assessment. Please note that the items below are suggestions to include in this section. You can use some or all of them plus additional ones to clearly explain the challenges your organisation is facing and the strategy you have in place.
