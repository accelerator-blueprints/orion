It is about the organisation acting as a leader within its ecosystem, recognised by others as a role model, rather than from the traditional perspective of a top team managing the organisation.\n\nIn an outstanding organisation, leadership is positioned as an activity not a role and leadership behaviours are evident across all levels and parts of the organisation. This role model leadership behaviour inspires others, reinforces, and when necessary, adapts the values and norms, helping to steer Organisational Culture.\n\nFor an organisation to achieve and sustain outstanding results that meet or exceed the expectations of its Stakeholders it is necessary, but not sufficient, for it to: \n- Define an inspiring Purpose\n- Create a Vision that is aspirational\n- Develop a Strategy that is centred on Creating Sustainable Value \n- Build a winning culture.\n\nThe Direction setting as outlined above, prepares the way forward for the organisation, but it then needs to execute its Strategy effectively and efficiently, ensuring that it:\n- Knows who the stakeholders are in its ecosystem and engages fully with those that are Key to its success\n- Creates Sustainable Value\n- Drives the levels of performance necessary for success today and, at the same time, drives the necessary improvement and transformation if it is to be successful in the future.",
