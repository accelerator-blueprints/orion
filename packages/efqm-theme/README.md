## TRANSLATIONS

* Uses the react-i18next library

* To add a new translation, first add the language two letter ICO abbreviation, full name, and flag ([Twemoji](https://twitter.github.io/twemoji/2/test/preview.html)) to ./config.js Doing so will automatically add the language to the language switcher that shows in the main toolbar.

* WARNING: All translations are case and spacing sensitive. You must match translations EXACTLY. Any playing around with casing in the code WILL break translations until the right casing is also added to translation files
